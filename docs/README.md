The doc uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.com/) theme.

Assuming [Jekyll] and [Bundler] are installed on your computer, you can preview the doc by the following:

1. Run `bundle install`.
2. Change your working directory to language variant (`zh` for Simplified Chinese, and `en` for English)
3. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and preview the doc at `localhost:4000`.
